###README for Iris Flower Classification Project**  

# **Iris Flower Classification**  
This repository showcases a machine learning project that classifies Iris flower species into three categories: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Using the classic Iris dataset, this project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## **Introduction**  
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, featuring 150 observations of Iris flowers. Each observation includes measurements of sepal and petal dimensions along with the species label. This project applies classification techniques to predict the species of a flower based on its features.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains:  
- **Features**:  
  - Sepal Length  
  - Sepal Width  
  - Petal Length  
  - Petal Width  
- **Target Classes**:  
  - Setosa  
  - Versicolor  
  - Virginica  

The dataset is preloaded in Scikit-learn, but you can also download it from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## **Project Steps**  
1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Explored feature distributions and relationships using histograms, correlation matrices, and scatter plots.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.  
   - Normalized data (optional).  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** for its robustness and interpretability.  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.  

5. **Prediction**  
   - Made predictions on unseen data inputs to test the model's generalization.

## **Dependencies**  
The following libraries are required to run the code:  
- Python 3.7+  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

To install the dependencies, run:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

---

## **Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd iris-classification  
   ```  

3. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python iris_classification.py  
   ```  

---

## **Results**  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved a high accuracy of 96% on the test data.  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized the performance for each class.  
- **Feature Importance**: Identified that petal width and petal length are the most important features for classification.
